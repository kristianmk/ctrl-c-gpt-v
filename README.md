# ctrl-c-gpt-v
A Python program for correcting spelling and grammar in clipboard content utilizing GPT-4.

**WARNING: If you press the 'rewrite' button, be informed that all content on your clipboard will be sent to OpenAI through their API.**

## Usage
1. Add you OpenAI API key. Currently, access to GPT-4 and API calls requires a subscription to the paid version.
2. Run `App.py` with your pyton interpreter.
3. Select a portion of text within a browser or an editor, and copy it to your clipboard. Anticipate the appearance of two buttons. By selecting 'Rewrite', the content will be transmitted to OpenAI and the original content on your clipboard will be replaced. You can then paste the improved version.

## In Summary:

`Ctrl+C  -->  GPT-4  -->  Ctrl+V`

(Naturally, utilize the command key in place of Ctrl if you are using MacOS)
